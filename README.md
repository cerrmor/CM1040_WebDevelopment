### Content Ideas
---
Content for Websiteidea of a Space and Technology theme. We can have attractions like-rides that simulate a rocket ship/space exploration-experiencing VR simulated alien planet exploring-display the change in technology over time and hint at new technology to come.-restaurants that serve foods that astronauts might eat.-showcase some of the popular imaginings of how the future would look for example Steam Punk theme/star trek. We can provide information on available services-how to buy tickets-where to stay if you are from out of town-open/close times-simplified park maps-where to find medical services/ help in the park-up and coming events- access to information about community involvement (this doesn't need to be front and center as it is not important to everyone visiting the park, but it should be available and clearly marked as to many people who live in the area that supports the park and has to deal with the crowds/ any bad publicity (ex. sea world and the orcas) it is important, and it puts a friendly face to the company.)
